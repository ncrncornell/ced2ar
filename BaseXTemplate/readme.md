Installation with CED2AR:

1. Deploy BaseX.war on your Tomcat 7+ server

2. Now you should change the default BaseX passwords. Go endpoint BaseX/rest. Default credentials are admin/admin

3. Change the password for the admin, writer and reader accounts using the command: 
```
/rest?command=alter password <username> <password> 
```

4. In the source code, navigate to /profiles/localtemp/config.properties. 
Change the values of basex.reader.hash, basex.writer.hash and basex.admin.hash. 
The hash is a base 64 encoding of `<username>:<password>`
(same as HTTP basic authentication format)

5. Rebuild your project. You may need to manually clear the values 
deployed in the tomcat directory 
/webapps/ced2ar-web/WEB-INF/classes/ced2ar-web-config.properties
