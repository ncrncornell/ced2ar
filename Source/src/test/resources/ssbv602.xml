      <abstract>
        <p>The SIPP Synthetic Beta (SSB) is a Census Bureau product that integrates person-level micro-data from a household survey with administrative tax and benefit data. These data link respondents from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to Social Security Administration (SSA)/Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2 records and SSA records of retirement and disability benefit receipt, and were produced by Census Bureau staff economists and statisticians in collaboration with researchers at Cornell University, the SSA and the IRS. The purpose of the SSB is to provide access to linked data that are usually not publicly available due to confidentiality concerns. To overcome these concerns, Census has synthesized, or modeled, all the variables in a way that changes the record of each individual in a manner designed to preserve the underlying covariate relationships between the variables. The only variables that were not altered by the synthesis process and still contain their original values are gender and a link to the first reported marital partner in the survey. Eight SIPP panels (1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2001, 2004, 2008) form the basis for the SSB, with a large subset of variables available across all the panels selected for inclusion and harmonization across the years. Administrative data were added and some editing was done to correct for logical inconsistencies in the IRS/SSA earnings and benefits data.</p>

      <dataProcessing>
        <p>Creation of the SSB:</p>
        <p>The SSB is created from several data sources. The survey data are drawn from
          multiple panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP):
          the 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, and 2004 panels. The administrative data
          are drawn from the following SSA files: the Master Earnings File, the Master
          Beneficiary Records (MBR), the Supplemental Security Records (SSR), the 831
          Disability File (F831), and the Payment History Update System (PHUS).</p>
        <p>The creation of the SSB begins with the construction of the Gold Standard
          File (GSF). To construct the GSF, a set of variables from the 1990-2004 SIPP
          panels are standardized to produce consistent measures across panels. The
          SIPP respondent identifiers are mapped to Social Security Numbers (SSB) using
          the Census Bureau's erson Information Validation System (PVS). Using the
          list of SSN's for the sample is SIPP respondents, SSA creates Summary
          Earnings Records (SER) and Detailed Earnings Record (DER) extracts from the
          Master Earnings File. SSA also creates extracts from the four benefit files
          (MBR, SSR, F831, and PHUS) from the corresponding master files. Using the
          mapping between the SIPP identifiers and SSN's, Census then links these
          extracts to the SIPP data. The GSF consists of person-level research
          variables created from these linked data.</p>
        <p>The next step in the creation of the SSB is to impute missing values in the
          GSF multiple times. This process results in four files (implicates) referred
          to as the Completed Data implicates. Each of these implicates contains
          original GSF values where non-missing and imputed values where the original
          value is missing. The imputations across Completed Data implicates are
          independent of each other.</p>
        <p>The Completed Data implicates from the basis of the data synthesis that
          produces the SSB files. From each Completed Data file, four synthetic
          datasets are created by synthesizing variables conditional on the values in
          the Completed Data file. Thus, the SSB consists of sixteen files (implicates).
          All but the following data are synthesized in the SSB implicates: gender,
          OASDI benefit type, and spouse link (specific variables described in the
          data items section below). Detailed documentation of the process of data
          synthesis is available in the publication "<ExtLink URI="http://www2.vrdc.cornell.edu/news/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/ssafinal.pdf">Final Report to the Social
            Security Administration on the SIPP/SSA/IRS Public Use File Project</ExtLink>" at<ExtLink URI="http://www2.vrdc.cornell.edu/news/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/ssafinal.pdf">http://www2.vrdc.cornell.edu/news/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/ssafinal.pdf</ExtLink>.</p>
        <p>The Completed Data and SSB implicates need not all have the same number of
          records. In order to be included in a Completed Data or SSB implicate, an
          individual's (possibly imputed or synthesized) age must be at least fifteen
          years as of January 1 in the first year of his or her SIPP panel. The
          interaction between this restriction and the variation in imputed and
          synthesized ages across implicates causes the exclusion of a slightly different set of individuals from each Completed Data and SSB implicate.</p>

          <p>This analysis was first performed using the SIPP Synthetic Beta (SSB) on the Synthetic Data Server housed at Cornell University which is funded by NSF Grants SES-1042181 and BCS-0941226, and through a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. These data are public use and may be accessed by researchers outside secure Census facilities. For more information, visit http://www.census.gov/sipp/synth_data.html. Final results for this paper were obtained from a validation analysis conducted by Census Bureau staff using the SIPP Completed Gold Standard Files and the programs written by this author and originally run on the SSB. The validation analysis does not imply endorsement by the Census Bureau of any methods, results, opinions, or views presented in this paper.</p>

        <disclaimer>The data synthesis process employed by Census to protect the linked data from the risk of disclosing the identity of individuals 
          is relatively new and substantially changes both the survey and administrative data. The intent of the modeling done as part of the synthesis 
          is to preserve relationships among variables that are of interest to researchers while ensuring that personally identifiable information is 
          not revealed to the data user. It has not been feasible to ensure accuracy by comparing every relationship among SSB variables with the 
          corresponding relationship in the underlying confidential micro-data. Hence, we strongly urge researchers not to publish results produced 
          from the SSB without first requesting that Census validate these results with confidential data housed in a secure environment at the 
          Census Bureau. Census will perform this validation free of charge to researchers, as resources permit and according to the protocol 
          established by the three agencies involved and outlined below. Without validation of results, Census, SSA, and IRS make no guarantee 
          of the validity of the SSB for any research purpose.

      <relMat label="Using SSB">
        <p>Using SSB:</p>
        <p>The GSF and Completed Data implicates contain personally identifiable
          information protected by Titles 13, 26, and 42 and cannot be accessed without
          Census Bureau Special Sworn Status nor outside of Census Bureau facilities.
          The SSB files, however, have been cleared by the Census Bureau Disclosure
          Review Board, SSA, and IRS for use by individuals without Census Bureau Special
          Sworn Status and outside of Census Bureau facilities.</p>
        <p>Researchers interested in using the SSB can submit an application to the Census
          Bureau. The application form and instructions can be downloaded from<ExtLink URI="http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sipp-synthetic-beta-data-product.html">http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/sipp-synthetic-beta-data-product.html</ExtLink>.
          Applications will be judged solely on
          feasability of the proposed project (i.e., that the necessary variables are
          available on the SSB). Once an application has been accepted, the new user will
          be given an account on a server where the data can be accessed and analyzed.
          While no SSB data downloads are permitted at this time, users do not have to
          operate behind the Census Bureau firewall to access this server.</p>
        <p>The SSB is designed to be analytically valid in that sense that point
          estimates should be unbiased and estimated variances should lead to inferences
          similar to those that would be drawn from an identical analysis on the Completed
          Data implicates. Initial tests of analytic validity of the SSB have been
          promising. All SSB users are invited to help further test the analytic validity
          of the SSB by submitting programs used to analyze the SSB to be run on the
          Completed Data and/or Gold Standard files. Users need only inform Census Bureau
          staff of the location on the server of such programs and work with Census Bureau
          staff to ensure that the programs run without error. Census Bureau staff will
          run the programs on the confidential data and release to the user resulting
          output that are cleared for release by the Census Bureau Disclosure Review
          Board. In order to evaluate the effects of the data synthesis separate from the
          effect of imputing missing data, comparisons should be made between results from
          the SSB and the Completed Data. To evaluate the effects of missing data
          imputation, comparisons should be made between results from the Completed Data
          and the Gold Standard.</p>
      </relMat>
      <relMat>When analyzing the SSB, users should account for the multiple imputation aspect
        of the SSB by averaging statistics of interests across all sixteen implicates.
        Variance measures should be created following the appropriate multiple
        imputation formulae as described in the document<ExtLink URI="http://www2.vrdc.cornell.edu/news/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/sipp_synthetic_beta_training_final_20071026.pdf">Using the SIPP Synthetic
          Beta for Analysis</ExtLink>.</relMat>
      <relMat label="Validation">
        <p>Protocol for Validation of Results:</p>
        <p>Census will validate results obtained from the SSB on the internal, confidential version of these data (Completed Gold Standard Files). Users who wish to obtain validated results should follow the protocol outlined here.
          The restricted access site will provide SAS and Stata analysis software and a computing environment similar to the one used to analyze the confidential Completed Gold Standard data on Census Bureau internal computers. Researchers should follow the Census Bureau programming requirements described in SSB Validation Request Guidelines to ensure that the programs will successfully transfer to internal Census computers for validation. Researchers should plan to share their results and programs from the synthetic data analysis with Census, ORES/SSA and SOI/IRS.
          After programs have successfully run without error on the synthetic data, researchers may request that Census run these programs on the Completed Gold Standard Files. Only programs successfully run without error on the SDS will be eligible to be run on the confidential data by Census staff. Any programs that produce errors on the Completed Gold Standard Files will be returned to users for correction.
          Once an analysis has been repeated on the Completed Gold Standard File, the results will be reviewed by Census staff for disclosure concerns. Researchers should familiarize themselves with standard Census disclosure rules for outside projects (See the<ExtLink URI="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/Researcher_Handbook_20091119.pdf">RDC Researcher Handbook</ExtLink>here) and should fill out the appropriate memo documenting the requested output (see<ExtLink URI="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/RDCDisclosureRequestMemo.pdf">RDC Disclosure Request Memo</ExtLink>). Data products and output approved by Census staff will be released to the users, ORES/SSA, and SOI/IRS.
          The validation process can be accomplished in as little as one week for simple results that are generated by clean code and have no disclosure issues. However if the code does not run properly, the sample sizes are too small, or the researcher does not accurately fill out the disclosure memo, the process can take much longer. Census makes no guarantee on the length of time between submission of programs and the release of results from the confidential data.
          For more information about the validation process, including advice on how to make the process go smoothly and quickly, please see<ExtLink URI="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/sipp/methodology/SSB%20Request%20Guidelines_May2013.pdf">SSB Validation Request Guidelines</ExtLink>.</p>

      <labl access="released" xml-lang="en">Date of Birth</labl>
      <txt>This variable was taken from a hierarchy of SSA sources instead of the respondent-provided value in the SIPP.  Date of birth was selected from the first non-missing value in the following files:  (i) SSA's Master Benefits Record (MBR) file, (ii) SSA's Supplemental Security Record (SSR) file, and (iii) the Census Bureau's Person Characteristic File (PCF) whose main input is the SSA Numident file.  Thus, this variable is administrative and sometimes differs from the birth date reported in the SIPP survey itself.  When missing due to the lack of a validated SSN for the SIPP respondent, date of birth was imputed using date of birth from the Census-internal version of the SIPP as a predictor variable.  We chose the administrative source for two reasons.  First, the administrative birth date was more consistent with the MBR and DER data and provided more accurate ages for first OASDI benefit receipt and first W-2 or self-employment earnings.  Second, the differences between the administrative birth date and the birth date reported in the survey helped to increase the difficulty of re-identifying a record in the original SIPP public use data using information from a record in the synthetic data, thus improving the confidentiality protections.  This variable is coded as a SAS date variable.  This format gives the number of days between the date of birth and January 1, 1960.  An individual born on January 1, 1959 would have birthdate=-365 and an individual born on January 1, 1961 would have birthdate=365.</txt>

This variable can be used to differentiate between people who do not have a high school degree (educ_5cat=1) but are still attending school and those who do not have a high school degree but are not currently attending high school.  Researchers should be careful to consider the age of the individual when using current_enroll_hs and educ_5cat.  Individuals who are still young children at the time of the SIPP will have educ_5cat=1 and current_enroll_hs=0 because they are still attending preschool or elementary school.  Older individuals with these values for the education variables can be classified as not having finished high school. Education variables come from the following waves, by panel: Wave 2 in the 1990-1993 panels (TM8400, TM8404, TM8406); Wave 2 in the 1996 panel (TLSTSCHL, THSYR); Wave 2 in the 1996-2008 panels (ELSTSCHL, EHSYR).

      <txt>This variable contains the administrative birthdate for the first biological child.  The universe for this variable is all women between the ages of 15 and 65 at the time of the fertility history topical module.  This variable was created by first looking for biological children on the SIPP household roster and choosing the birthdate of the oldest child (if no children were found, the value was set to missing).  The total number of biological children reported on the roster (could possibly be zero) was then compared to the woman's report in her fertility history about the number of children born to her. If the number born to her was larger, first_admin_birthdate was set to missing and imputed using the woman's report of the first year she gave birth as a predictor variable. This process allowed us to create a fertility history that was consistent with the children reported on the roster and their administrative birthdates but still handle cases where older children or all children lived outside the household.</txt>

This base survey weight is the inverse of the probability of selection for the sample unit, adjusted only for unit non-response and, in rare instances, for sampled units that turned out to represent more than one separate residence. Unlike final panel and calendar year weights, INITWGT includes no adjustment for attrition of households from SIPP panels and are not adjusted at the person level to match any external controls.  SSB users can utilize the weights to produce estimates that account for idiosyncratic probability of selection of sample units and for unit-nonresponse. Estimates for each SIPP panel, using these weights, become representative of the U.S. non-instutionalized population as of the beginning of the panel. For instance, using INITWGT, the distribution of calendar year 2010 administrative earnings for sample persons in the SSB from the 1984 SIPP panel would be representative of the U.S. population as of calendar year 1984.</txt>

      <txt>In the Census-internal SIPP panels, a value for sex is included on each wave file.  Thus, there are actually as many sex variables as there are waves of the survey and some changes occur across waves as a result of data collection error.  Sex is selected from the array of variables sex1-sex{max number of waves} in which the wave corresponds either to the month in which marital status is first observed (for those without spouses during the course of the SIPP) or to the month in which the respondent's spouse is assigned.  As with the SIPP, the SSB does not allow same-sex couples to report being married and hence gender must be chosen to be consistent with the spouse's gender instead of from a fixed point in the survey.  Thus when a spouse is never assigned, an individual's gender comes from the first wave where they report being not married.  For individuals who are assigned a spouse, gender comes from the first wave where they reveal their spouse.
This indicator variable is set to 1 if the individual was male and was created from the original categorical sex variable for analytic convenience.This variable is unsynthesized on the SSB and is never missing so there are no imputed values in the Completed Data.</txt>

Details for up to four SSDI applications are maintained.

The first recorded application, the last recorded application, the first recorded application during the SIPP interview period, and the last recorded application during the SIPP interview period are always kept. For example, if a person applied for SSDI three times, this will be reflected in the following way: mbr_ssdi_applied_1 = 1, mbr_ssdi_applied_2 = 1, mbr_ssdi_applied_3 = 1, mbr_ssdi_applied_4 = 0.</p>

Occupation is chosen by summing earnings associated with the array of variables ws1occ1-ws1occ{max number of waves} and ws2occ1-ws2occ{max number of waves} in the 1984, 1990-1993 panels, and tjbocc1_1-tjbocc1_{max number of waves) and tjbocc2_1-tjbocc2_{max number of waves} in the 1996-2008 panels and choosing the occupation associated with the greatest total earnings.  Thus occupation is the occupation from which greatest earnings are derived in the survey.</txt>

Race is chosen by creating an array of variables race1-race{max number of waves} and choosing the first non-missing value.

For example, if a person is in the first rotation group of the 1990 panel, his/her wave 1 interview covered January 1990-April 1990 and the wave 2 interview covered May 1990-August 1990.  The wave 2 topical modules would have been asked in September 1990 at the time of the wave 2 interview.  Schedules for interviewing rotation groups by panel can be found in the SIPP Users' Guide.</txt>

      <txt>Personid of linked spouse, defined as the first person to whom the SIPP respondent was married during the time period covered by the SIPP panel.  Individuals could enter the panel already married and then each would be linked to the other.  Individuals could also get married during the course of the panel.  If this was the first observed marriage for each member of the couple, they were linked together.  Individuals could also get divorced during the course of the panel and then remarry.  In many cases, this later marriage caused a new individual to join the panel.  This new SIPP respondent would only be linked to his or her spouse if the spouse (and original SIPP sample member) had not already been observed married to someone else.  If the original SIPP sample member had been previously linked by marriage to another SIPP sample member, this original link was maintained in spouse_personid.  However the marital history reflects the ending of this marriage and the occurrence of the next marriage for the original SIPP sample member.  Likewise, the new SIPP sample member who joins through marriage will have that marriage date recorded in his or her marital history but will have a blank spouse_personid.  In summary, this variable captures only one marriage partner and does not provide a history of marriage partners even if this history is (partially) observed in the SIPP.    The link between SIPP respondents and their spouses has not been perturbed in any way in the SSB.  The same individuals will be linked as married partners in the Gold Standard, the Completed Data, and the SSB.   In order to strengthen confidentiality protection, however, spouse_personid in the SSB does not link records across implicates or to the Gold Standard and Completed Data files, i.e. within each synthetic implicate it is a random number that can only be used for matching spouses within that implicate.</txt>

      <txt>Indicates the total number of quarters of FICA-covered work in year YYYY, where YYYY=1951-2011.  In 2011, an individual received credit for one quarter of coverage for every $     he/she earned at a FICA-covered job in the year.  In 1978, $250 was required in order to be credited one quarter of coverage.  This number increases automatically each year and is tied to increases in average wages.  A maximum of 4 quarters per year is possible.  Quarters of coverage are used to calculate eligibility for OASDI benefits.  For example, people who reached age 62 in 2011 were eligible to retire if they had at least 40 quarters of coverage.  The number of quarters of coverage required to be fully insured has changed over time.  See http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/reports/crsleghist2.html for a summary of rules.

Prior to 1978, a quarter of coverage was granted for every quarter of the calendar year in which the worker had at least $50 in earnings at a FICA-covered job.  Hence the portion of this array from 1951-1977 provides more detail about whether a worker was employed throughout the year. However caution should be used when looking at these earlier years as far fewer jobs were FICA-covered and hence zero quarters of coverage does not mean the person as not employed but rather that the person was not employed by a job that required FICA taxes or made the person eligible for OASDI benefits.</txt>
