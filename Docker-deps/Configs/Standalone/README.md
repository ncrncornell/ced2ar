# Release Notes of CED2AR developers
 
The default standalone config is just what is generated by CED2AR on initialization,
but since the configuration options may periodically change upon new releases of
new versions of CED2AR, these config files may need to be periodically updated.
To do this:

1. Instead of using `standalone.sh`, use `fat_entry.sh`, which should be the same as
`standalone.sh` but without any volume mounts of configuration files.

2. Once the container is running, use `docker cp` to copy out any desired config files
(make sure to do this from this directory):

```
docker cp ced2ar:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ced2ar-web/WEB-INF/classes/ced2ar-user-config.properties ./
```

3. Update manually any other configuration sets that may need upating (e.g. the Triangle).
